# 💻 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of projects I developed to support my learning process throughout university. All projects were created as part of academic practice and are shared as elements of my personal portfolio and as reference material for fellow learners interested in exploring machine learning and data science techniques. The code and resources provided are intended solely for educational and demonstrative purposes.

⚠ Note: These projects were built strictly for learning objectives. Please avoid using the code directly in production environments without proper review and further refinement.
